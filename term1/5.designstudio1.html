         Last summer&#127774 I exchanged the surroundings from my job in Joure and hometown Rouveen in the Netherlands for a apartment inside the house of a Argentinian lady in La Teixonera in Barcelona. As a way to map the changes that this international/cultural/professional transition included this page illustrates the things I left back in my previous reality and the things I surround myself in my current reality.&#128302</br>
         <br>
         I spent my Sundaymorning walking to the edge of the city, close to the starting point from where we walked to the Torre Vigia Monbau &#127748 about two weeks ago.
        My objective for the day was to hike uphill to Mirador de Cerdanyola and capture and geo-tag as many interesting pictures of plants and/or animals as I could. This data I could later upload on the iNaturalist platform to get feedback and learn more about this system.<br> 
        In total the trip took me a bit more than two hours. My first intention was to do a little roundtrip since my objective would not change on the way back. So as I got near to the Mirador I started looking for alternative paths back but there were none. 
        The only option was to take  the same way back and it suprised me to see how I could miss a lot of interesting things (plants, viewpoints, structures) despite trying to be receptive to these signals.  </br>
        Later I got back to the parking lot next to the building where I started, which turned out to be a prison. 
        Afterwards I uploaded my foundings on the iNaturalist-website as being a experimental prototype. I was suprised to receive quick feedback to the classifications I assigned my pictures to. 
        Since my taxonomical skills are very very limited I only used the automatically generated classifactions which were than reviewed by the community&#128107.
        This training of perceptional skills was nice to do and it felt as being a step closer to the First Person Perspective (1PP) I would want to work in.

        <strong style= color:grey;>Output:</strong> An experimental digital prototype on the iNaturalist platform and a initial visualization of my new reality.
