                  Also named 'The Field', Curating Normals started in the first week of the third term. In it we worked on applying curatorial practice to think about and develop tools for contextualising, positioning and framing work as part of new narratives.

              Daniel started the session by letting us pick an object starting with the same letter as our first names. The first topic related to our practize was the sharpening the definitions of 'communities' and 'networks', both plural. Combining both into a 'Communities & Networks' framework. As example 
            Daniel pointed out for this framework were his experiences with education, product design and studiowork. A community of place allows people to learn each others habbits and uses. A format can be great but not guaranteed to be succesfull if not considered the offering to it's community.

                Feedback on our exhibition proposal called 'Post-human  Perception and Interconnections' included a revision of our title and placement of our projects onto the exhibition structure.
Next up is mapping stakeholders. The interactivity element of project Lemna might as well be a first step in a possible overlap with gamers.

              <p> Which parents, teachers, urban planners, local government representatives etc. The specification of actors is important in defining project participators.
                Where do we want to see change. Farm techniques to the city or bringing urban connectiveness to rural contexts, or both? Categorizing our projects caused some vaguenesses and unexpected overlapping.
