                  challenged us to construct our own brand-canvas.

              I am part of the older gen Z (born in 1996-99), those with the last realistic chance on having a 
              truly analogue childhood, matured together with Instagram. It’s the generation that is proposed everything in endless opportunities.
               In a more clear, exposed manner than those before them, <strong>they grope for meaning. </strong>They know the game,
                they know how things work and - moreso - they know that they don’t make them work. They know very well that it has gotten to the 
                point where it’s their turn to put in the work. It’s their time to success their parents in dealing with world’s problems. 
                They’re clever and their cleverness hinders them. They want to work but not to commit. They want the clarity in the life path that 
                others have cause their life is reaching a climax of indecision. Everything is speeding up and people and things get stronger and 
                smarter. But with a cost. We are realizing that rather than thinkers, we need do-ers, we need dirty hands. We need to de-digitalize. 
                We need less instagram reels, less screen time. We need to walk outside more, we need to pick up one other’s trash more, we need to appreciate 
                the efforts of our parents more, we need the lessons that our grandparents still can share, we need to look at plants more. We need to take our 
                time and let things grow. We need to be reminded of the life in and around us. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With the project I try to perceive and understand my generation and me in this brief moment in time.

                The second session of the Communication, Brand and Pupose class were a respite in practical triggering sense after the more theoratic Making Sense and Meaning class.
