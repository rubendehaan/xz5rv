                  Lorenzo Patuzzo is Project Lead at the Akasha Hub in Barcelona. Lorenzo was first-hand involved in the first steps on the development of Ethereum.
                  In his seminiar he explained us his story, work and collaborations.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>
              Lorenzo presented his work on blockchain as creating a different paradigm for the society. Society has a layered operational system in 
              which one does not cross a red-light, one goes to work and one pays his bills. A series of interesting questions and statements he proposed us:
              <ul>
                  <li>"Is society getting better or worse?"</li>
                  <li> "Was society 50 years ago better or worse than now?"</li>
                  <li>"There used to be more wars in the past than nowadays but we didn't know, 
                    <br>now we do know but we forget them."</li>
                  <li>"What if we had the option to vote every four minutes instead of every four years?"</li>
                  <li>"What's the line between moderation and censorship?"</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            Continuing on society's layering Lorenzo spoke about Bitcoin's origin and ideology. Assumably invented
            and written down by Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin's goal was to decentralize and de-institutionalize financial transactions.
            Sharing this same ideal Lorenzo (as art director) was 1/13 of the original <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" class="link">Ethereum Foundation</a> collaborating at Calafou and several locations
            in Switzerland.
          </p>
          <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
          <p>
            Examples of Smart Contracts are Chain.link's, Buildspace.so, IOHK's Cardano and Ethereum World. On all of 
            these platforms people are free to suggest adjustments (e.g. EIP) and build on the networks, either via developping, voting or more. In this way the softwares serve as organizations themselves
            instead of being 'owned'. Guillem explained a few of these scenarios as possibilities for turning into Web 3.0. 
          </p>
          <h3>Oracles</h3>
          <p>
            As Lorenzo touched on, the interaction between analog, real-life world and encrypted, digital world is one of the cruxes in 
            the current state of blockchain development. How do we validate that a farmer plants a tree if someone pays him via a smart contract?
            And if we somehow can, how do we ensure this will on long-term?
          </p>
          <h3>Transaction</h3>
          <p>
            After the session the question came to mind about how much energy a transaction consumes in comparison to current fintech solutions (e.g. Paypal).
            Chris forwarded me the following stat
