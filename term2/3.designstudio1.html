          <h2>Design studio 1</h2>
          
            <p class="intro"> Second trimester started off with direct reflection; What did we do in term one, what did we do differently in comparison to previous work and how do we utilize these differences in the upcoming term?
          </p>

          <p>The most noticable difference that came to mind was the shift from the underlying assumption that design should always starts fresh, clean, new, imported, uncut, unpainted and untreated.
            Learning what could initiate by re-imagining what is at hands is much more interesting. 
            Tinkering, coming up with on-the-spot, improvised solutions applied in context, serving a function no less than a untouched material would. 
            <br>
            Another learning point was the introduction to HTML-language, online documentation and more extensive and expressive writing in general.
            This allowed a more introspective approach and better digestion of the course-material.
            <br>
            A third takeaway was that the transition to a more hybrid form of work can come in quite a natural refined matter and time-frame.
            From October on I began to experiment a bit with freelance- and personal work. Spreading this workload out weekly and alternating between projects
            is luxurious.
