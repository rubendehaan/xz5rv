          <h3>Session 1: January 19th</h3>
          <p>
            In its first meeting we got introduced to the course's literature and a series of names of possible lecturers with variant backgrounds and expertises.
            As preperation for the second course several sources of literature and reference material was presented to us. Out of these items
            the material from John Verveake's 'Awakening from the Meaning Crisis' spoke most to me. Listening to his more ordinary explanation about how in the past years some tendacy has risen to the surface in which
            individuals seek eagerly for meaning was very relatable. Thinking of it, a few weeks ago I started blocking all the selfproclaimed motivational videos that were suggested to me by Instagram pages and Youtube accounts in which
            billionaires and athletes point people at their 'life-goal' to 'succeed'.
            </p>
            <p>
            To name an - in my opinion - more founded example, Dr. Jordan Peterson, a popular clinical psychologist shares ideas for individuals to find their meaning and ways for self-improvement. His podcast has weekly episodes and he joins other's to widely
            discuss heavy topics that attract a lot of (mainly) male youngsters. When asked on why he thinks his ideas are so attractive nowadays he stated: 
            <br></br>
            <i>"People need so little encouragement. Someone telling them to clean their room is often enough for a first step
            to finding meaning. Your frontier doesn't have to be continents to explore or wars to win. There are plenty of problems that will present themselves to you as being your problem that require you solving them. Solve them."</i>
