            <a href="https://www.cccb.org/en/participants/file/jose-luis-de-vicente/11244" class="link">Jose Luis de Vicente </a>is a cultural researcher and curator working in the space between the arts, technology, and innovation. Since 2012 he has been an associated curator for FutureEverything. He is the curator of Sónar +D, the digital culture and creative technologies conference and exhibition part of Barcelona’s acclaimed Sónar Festival. 
          </p>
          <p>Jose started off with the question: "What is a job?". Some of the answers that were pointed out included the following:
            <ul>
              <li>A trade of time.</li>
              <li>An exchange of efforts.</li>
              <li>A creation of self-worth.</li>
              <li>The generating of purpose.</li>
              <li>Motherhood</li>
              <li>Your role in your community.</li>
              <li>The repetition one does.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            In Jose's own words a job essentially is:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The means by which the economy produces.</li>
              <li>The means by which the people develop their purpose.</li>
            </ul> 
            </p>
            <p>
                          In current times 99% of the people own 50% of all the money. Globally half of all the money is labour-derived and the other half is capital-derived
