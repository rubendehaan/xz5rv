                  With the program's courses running in parallel, a lot of activities are running simultaneously and keeping up with all of the 
                  different topics is challenging.

              <p>
                In sessions with Jonathan Minchin and Tomas Vivanco discussing proceedings on the Duckweed project some major feedback
                was that an awareness of the implicit- and explicit reasoning (and the difference between both) for the project was lacking.

              </p>
              <p>
                A first logic step towards this would be to change the project's name into one that does not address it expression.

            <p>
              Now that the courses are spread out over a longer period instead of successing each other one after another, I experience a lot of noise inbetween lectures.
              In my case, as well as in general for the class, the attention shifts more to each's own projects and the classes don't necessarily feel in line with these projects.

           <p>
              Together with Vikrant I made a proposal for running experiments at a company working on aquaponics. Designing and creating a place in which 
              we can grow the plants controlled is appealing. By contacting them we try to expand our experimental space and facilities and open
              doors to new collaborators. Till now the duckweed did not disappoint us in the research tests on growth and taste. Ofcourse there are hundred reasons why
              the duckweed as product could not work out (e.g. food safety, water quality, consistency, diseases..) but the plant clearly holds some nice, non-farfetched opportunities  
              that are worth the efforts.
