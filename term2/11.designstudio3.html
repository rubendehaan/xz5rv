              <p class="intro">
                  Digesting Sergio's talk on responsible design the third Design Studio touched on the 'why' of our projects and how we 
                  shape our next steps.
              </p>
    
              <h3>Project continuation</h3> 
              <p>
                Getting closer to the community. Considering who does and doesn't benefit from our initiatives and how this is developing over time.
              </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Work on multiscalar design space to look for new intervention opportunities</li>
                  <li>Find opportunities using the RI tool</li>
                  <li>Is there an intervention you can design that responds to a guiding question coming from the RI tool?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                All human and non-human agents have a role in the trajectory of the project.

              <h3>Q&A</h3>
              
            <ul>
                  
              <li> Do you feel responsible for the actors of your project?</li>
              <i>To some extend, yes. Involving them and re-ideating to their responses is what I feel most responsible for.
              <br>Beyond that point that sense of responsibilty does fade - or has to - at least, since it gets in the way 
              <br>of making next steps.</i>
              <li>Where do you set the boundaries of your experiental community?</li>
              <i>Ideally the community around the project has some healthy sense of personal interest in correct outcomes.
              <br> So when the communal boundaries are at feedback and communication on a regular basis during the process
              <br> it would already be quite an achievement.</i>
              <li> What do I know and what not about my project? (assumptions, interests, values..)</li>
              <i>On a certain level I know what the product needs to grow into which outcome. I know the paths in which
              <br> the project can head and which (design)decisions lead to that. I am aware of its uncertainties and weaknesses.
              </i>

              <li>Am I commited enough?</li>
              <i>Yes</i>
              <li>In what sense am I corresponding to an interest, a need or an expectation of socio-technical contexts?</li>
              <i>The post-truth era is real and the recent increase of social consciousness on our impact on earth is a good thing.
              <br> If the project can contribute to those developments in - perhaps - unexpected ways and places maybe some<br>
              of the choices we make as self-convinced consumers can be rethought.
              </i>
              <li>How do you promote diversity and inclusivisity and how adaptable is your project?</li>
              <i>The project is centered around a versatile, tiny plant. While discussing it the response usually varied between 
                <br>ridiculing it and being intrigued by it. In the first place, seeing those reactions really exposes both the 
                <br> character and stigmas accosiated with Duckweed but maybe even moreso, Duckweed shows a bit of the 
                <br>characteristics of its perceiver. </i>
