            <br> The objective was to collect in about fifteen minutes some low-cost, low-effort materials of which we could make a prototype. This product had to represent what we were doing and what our current stance in the project-orientation is.</br>
            <br></br>
            I cut linear C-shapes in a coffeecup, connected a thin rope to its end and integrated it onto a PET waterbottle filled with soil. The cup being the representitive of my head, the bottle my body and the rope my arms and efforts. Pulling the rope would open the cup as a metaphor for 
            my process of learning, trying and reflecting troughout the studies. The soil inside the bottle stood for the earth beneath our feet that literally is the common ground in everything we do. The reason for the soil being inside the bottle rather than
            outside of it is because aside from external aspects I also feel a need for a pragmatic introspective standpoint.  <br></br>
         <strong style= color:grey;>Group reflection:</strong><br>
          The interventions in the group revolve around various discourses one makes, in search for identity of oneself. There is a shared common interest in finding a balance between the internal and the external parts of life. This balance is explored by different ways of engagement tied together by a common aspect of positionality.</br>
