            <h1>Reflection 01: Bootcamp</h1>
              <p>The past week activities were centered around the question: "What is your fight?" <br>
              Well, what is my fight?.. To find that out I updated a map/mindmap I made in june last year </br> of my interests and interconnect them to find out where that fight was hiding.
              In the first se- <br>ssion I had them narrowed down to a selection of interest (see 2nd image) but it didn't seem </br> really clarifying and authentic to me when it passed and faced the dialogues between class- <br>mates. During these sessions I got to know most of their interesting stories and motivations <br> which varied from being fed up with plastic waste to pursueing emotional intelligent design, </br> from finding peace to creating bridges between people through design. Obiously, all of them, <br> great stories and really helpful in guiding next step of finding and defining my fight. </br>
              </p>
              <p>On friday we did a tour through Poblenou (industrial neighbourhood where IAAC is located, <br> see 3rd image) and got introduced to some local, sustainable initiatives: Poblenou Urban </br>District, TransfoLAB BCN, BiciHub and ConnectHort (will be called Bioma soon). Saturday I <br>went back to ConnectHort for preparing clay to cover the walls of a biobuilt cabin (see 4th <br>image) which was something equally fun as informative.
              Yesterday we did some ideation</br> excersises on Miro platform and I sat down with one of the course-leaders to check where <br> the fight was located now and, for the time being, it got pretty clear.</br>
              "So this will 'kill' some of the chaos around the fight than isn't it?" <br>
              "This will create way more chaos."</br>
              Great, can't wait.</p>
